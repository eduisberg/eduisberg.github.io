500 Cities Project:

Brief from the UNH Analytics & Data Science Master’s program - the hardest thing I have ever undertaken (and highly rewarding). A mere two months into the program, my Summer Practicum team (Cristiano Costa, Tejaswini Arumalla and me) were tasked with applying Principal Components Analysis (“PCA”, a dimensionality reduction technique), to analyze 2.4mm health measurement data points from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”). The quality of the CDC’s 500 Cities dataset is outstanding by the way. 

Below is a summary of our findings. Thanks to Professors Prashant Mittal and Joanna Gyory for their invaluable guidance, then and going forward. Even more thanks to my family (Kristin, Grace, Henry) for letting dad do this crazy thing. I hope to add more of our projects to this site as time and NDAs allow.
